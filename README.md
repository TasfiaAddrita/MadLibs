# Madlibs

## Description
Mad Libs typically starts by prompting you (the user) to provide words based on the various parts of speech:, typically adjectives, nouns, and verbs. Once you have provided those words, they get placed into a short story with blanks for the specific parts of speech (i.e. if you’re prompted for two adjectives and one verb, the story will have two blanks for adjectives and one blank for a verb).

## Goals
### Requirements
- [x] Provide a Mad Libs story for users to fill in
- [x] Collect user input for the words
- [x] Print the story with all blanks filled in by the user’s words
- [x] Use at least 3 parts of speech for word replacement
- [x] Use variable assignment to store/use values
- [x] Write and call functions
- [x] Use at least one of the following core data types: strings, integers, floats
- [x] Use at least one of the following collection types: lists, tuples, dictionary


### Stretch Challenges
- [x] Handles improper user input
- [x] Story uses formatting and colors to provide a richer experience
- [x] The story uses 4+ parts of speech
- [x] Randomize the words of the same type (ie shuffle the 5 nouns in terms of which noun blanks they go into).
- [ ] Use a list of words from a dictionary to generate words randomly if the user requests it.
- [ ] Use a different data structure to store words.
- [x] Build with test driven development (TDD)
- [ ] Use the system module (for accessing command-line arguments)
- [ ] Add ASCII art/design to your story
- [ ] Take Mad Libs out of the terminal and have it running as a website
